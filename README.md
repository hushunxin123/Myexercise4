The library management system has successfully realized the operation of creating, deleting, reading and updating books. If you want to change the status of the book and add the reservation time, select 5. To be honest, this code can still be optimized. For example, the system is only satisfied to add books when there are no books in the database.
The additional assignment for theme modeling has been completed and the results can be visualized on test.html, where I tried to use Copilot to fix the error for me, for example, it told me that versions of gensim and pyLDAvis were incompatible.
